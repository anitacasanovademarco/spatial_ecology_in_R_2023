# Assign to an object
zima <- 2 + 3

# Calculations
zima * duccio
final <- zima * duccio


##### Array
# they're functions
# fuctions always have parenthesis and inside them there're the arguments

# Examples
sophi <- c(10,20,30,50,70) # microplastics
paula <- c(100, 500, 600, 1000, 2000) #people

# we can plot them together
plot(paula, sophi, xlab="number of people", ylab="microplastics")

# we can also previously assign paula and sophi to some objects
people <- paula
microplastics <- sophi
plot (people, microplastics, pch=19, cex=2, col="blue") # pch gives the shape of the symbols in R, cex represents the size, col for the color

# we can find the symbols in this site:

# http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/r-plot-pch-symbols-the-different-point-shapes-available-in-r

# ----------------------

# 02.1 Population densities

# Codes related to POPULATION GROWTH

# Let's install spatstat, which allows us to make a SPATIAL POINT PATTERN ANALISYS

install.packages("spatstat") # QUOTES are needed to protect the package we want to install which is outside R

#the function library(spatstat) is used to check if the package has already been installed
library(spatstat)

# we are using data in GitHub, which is  outside R, in order to previously understand how they work

#DATA DESCRIPTION
# Let's use some datasets provided by spatstat, like BEI DATA 
#(The dataset bei gives the positions of 3605 trees of the species Beilschmiedia pendula (Lauraceae) 
# in a 1000 by 500 metre rectangular sampling region in the tropical rainforest of Barro Colorado Island)

# PLOTTING  DATA FROM SPATSTAT (see what it represents)
plot(bei) 
# as the points are too big for this area, we'll change their shape

# CHANGING DATA DIMENSION - cex
plot(bei,cex=.5)

# why are the trees clumbed in some area?

#CHANGING THE SYMBOL  - pch
plot(bei,cex=.2,pch=19) #search the number of R symbols on the internet

#ADDITIONAL DATASETS
bei.extra # it has two variables: elevation (elev) and gradient (grad). 
# They allow us to understand the distribution of bei datas

plot(bei.extra) #here we have the raster file =! vector file

# Let's use only part of the dataset: elev
bei.extra$elev  #$ sign links elevation to the dataset
plot(bei.extra$elev) 
elevation <- plot(bei.extra$elev)  #elevation has been assignet to an homonimous object, simple to find

#second method to select elements
bei.extra[1] #take the fist element, so it's another way to isolate elevation
elevation2 <- bei.extra[[1]]
plot(elevation2)

# INTERPOLATION: passing from points to a continuous surface 
densitymap<-density(bei) #the densitymap gives us info about the distribution of pixel
plot(densitymap)

#Let's overlap  bei points to the densitymap
points(bei, cex=.2)

#Avoid pictures with a combination of blue, green and red colors as daltonic people can't see them

#Let's change the colors
# You can find them in this website:
# http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf
cl <- colorRampPalette(c("black", "red", "orange", "yellow"))(100) #R is capital letters sensitive!!!
#100 represents the different colors that can be present between those chosen
plot(densitymap, col=cl)

#Use yellow colour in a proper way, cause it's the most impacting one

#the quality is much worse if we put a smaller number, like
cl <- colorRampPalette(c("black", "red", "orange", "yellow"))(4)
plot(densitymap, col=cl)

# MULTIFRAME (shows different plots at the same time)
par(mfrow=c(1,2)) #1 row and 2 columns, and they're part of an array
# and then the two plots 
plot(densitymap)
plot(elev)

# We can compare quantitative (points in the graph) and qualitative (images RGB) data, by taking a picture in the image and analyze the waves it reflects
# Thay we try to guess the element according to the reflectance: water for example reflects NIR and red

# Pixels = training sites, expressing the main classes or clusters. They're set of individual objects having the same features. In this case the main classes are agricutural areas, forests, etc.

# 10 Variability

# Measurement of R based variability
# there are different indices in statistics: the most simple thing in our case was to measure the standard deviation, that is how much the different data are divergin from the mean
# we measured it with the focal() function

library (imageRy)
library(terra)
library(viridis)

im.list()

sent <- im.import("sentinel.png") # Similaun Glacier

# band 1 = NIR
# band 2 = red
# band 3 = green

im.plotRGB(sent, r = 1, g = 2, b = 3)

# snow in white, lake in black

im.plotRGB(sent, r = 2, g = 1, b = 3)

nir <- sent[[1]]
plot(nir) # 8 bit image as it distributed in a range between 0 and 250

# MOVING WINDOW APPROACH FOR DIVERSITY ASSESSMENT
# we are going to calculate the standard deviation (sd) of windows of pixels, one at the time
# in the end we would have passed the window in the whole image, calculating each time the sd value of the central pixel of the window 

# calculate the standard deviation with the function: focal()

sd3 <- focal(nir, matrix(1/9,3,3), fun=sd) # avoid givid the name sd without numbers cause it can be confused with the value of the standard deviation

# use of the nir band, matrix describes the dimension of the moving window. it is composed by 9 pixels, so they go from 1 to 9 (written as 1/9). In general we use squared matrices. The function calculated is the standard deviation (sd).

plot(sd3)

cl<-colorRampPalette(viridis(7))(255) # the 7th palette of viridis, with 255 different colors used

plot(sd3, col=cl) # northwest part is the area where the variability is higher

# let's calculate the variability in a 7x7 moving window
sd7 <- focal(nir, matrix(1/49,7,7), fun=sd)
plot(sd7, col=cl) 
# sd in a smaller window will give a local calculation and see subtile differences
# with larger windows, the resulting picture will include additional pixels, so it will be less precise

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(sd3, col=cl)
plot(sd7, col=cl)

# original image plus the 7x7 sd
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
im.plotRGB(sent, r = 2, g = 1, b = 3)
plot(sd7, col=cl) # the line on the top left reflects a lot of variability; it can be due to snow or a clowd better recognized in the nir picture. Other times it can be due to geological or botanical variability
