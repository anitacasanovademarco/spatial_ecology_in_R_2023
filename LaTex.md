# *How does it work*?
+ Start phrases with \
+ Arguments inside graph parentesis
+ Comment symbol is %
+ The R library function is here called "usepackage"
+ To write the date you can directly put it, or, you can put % before it, so your laptop will use the date you created your document. To remove it, just write date{}
+ The abstract describes the idea of the paper in few words
+ Everytime you use the begin function there must be also an end function
+ To start a new paragraph, just leave an empty line between your paragraphs: it will leave a space between them. If you don't want it, jjust write \noindent
+ To start a new paragraph, just use the functions \bigskip or \smallskip: it will leave a whole line between them.
+ To modify the defaul 10 pt of the document, just write [12] before \documentclass{article}, like this: \documentclass[12pt]{article}
