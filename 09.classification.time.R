#Estimating the qualitative and quantitative different between two different images in two different times
#We need to transform images in classes (land cover, land use, etc.)

#Satellite image of the Alps: green snow, blue pastures, green forests, pink villages
# We can compare quantitative (points in the graph) and qualitative (images RGB) data, by taking a picture in the image and analyze the waves it reflects
# Thay we try to guess the element according to the reflectance: water for example reflects NIR and red

# Pixels = training sites, expressing the main classes or clusters. They're set of individual objects having the same features. In this case the main classes are agricutural areas, forests, etc.

# How to classify pixels? From : we can estimate if the pixel represents an urban area or a forest using the the minimum distance from the class we think it belongs
